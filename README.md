# CRUD MERN demo website

This is a full-stack web application that I'm in the process of making by following a [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/VsUzmlZfYNg). This will serve as the basis for my future personal website. I don't have a working website yet nor some screenshots, so I've outlined some things I've worked on:

1. Set up client-side and server-side.
2. Set up MongoDB.
3. Implementing routes.
